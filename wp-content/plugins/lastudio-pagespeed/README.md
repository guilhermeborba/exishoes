LaStudio PageSpeed is a completely new way of optimizing your page speed. It works even on top of your existing optimizations.

== Description ==

LaStudio PageSpeed is a completely new way of optimizing your page speed. It works even on top of your existing optimizations, including:

* Autoptimize
* WP Rocket
* WP Total Cache
* WP Super Cache
* LiteSpeed Cache

LaStudio PageSpeed is not compatible with:

* Nitropack

= INTRODUCTORY NOTE =

The plugin might not work for someone.

Don't hesitate to install and test, the plugin is made to leave no trace on the disk or in the database upon deactivation and removal.

* If you are not happy with the result - just uninstall the plugin
* If something stops working - let me know, I will either fix the problem, or list a compatibility issue here

= HOW IT WORKS =

If user doesn't start interacting with page immediately, LaStudio PageSpeed postpones loading and firing scripts until after page gets rendered, giving you **2x-5x** boost in your Pagespeed metric.

This postponement in script loading greatly improves perceived load times for your visitors. It also significantly improves the following **important SEO metrics**:

* [Page Speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
* [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)
* [Time To Interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/tti/)
* [Total Blocking Time (TBT)](https://web.dev/tbt/)

In May 2021, Google will incorporate [multiple page speed metrics](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience) as a search signal in the ranking algorythm

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/lastudio-pagespeed` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings -> LaStudio PageSpeed screen to configure the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
